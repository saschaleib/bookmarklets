# bookmarklets
A collection of more or less useful bookmarklets to improve your web browsing experience.

This is a collection of Bookmarklet scripts that I created for my own use. They are published here for others to use and enjoy.

Please note that while I try to make them as cross-platform and standard-compliant as possible, I am in fact mostly using Firefox and I rarely test anything on any other browser. If I know about any incompatibilites, I list them below, but it is likely that these lists are not exhaustive.

Regardless of my own testing, all the scripts are provided “as is”, i.e. no guarantees for proper functioning or otherwise are given, and of course I take no responsibility if things go wrong for whatever reason.

Overview:

The following bookmarklets are include in the current version:

1. Generated Content
  Generate content to be inserted into any text field.

  1.1 Insert current Date/Time
    Inserts the current date at the cursor position in any text input field. Enter a format string and select it before calling the bookmarklet for more options.

  1.2 Calculate Formula
    Calculates the result of a mathematical formula. Simply enter the formula in any text field, select it and then run the bookmarklet. The result will replace the formua. Please note the security informations for this script.
    
2. Unicode Character Insertion
  These are dynamically generated bookmarklets to insert specific Unicode characters into any text field (also works for Emojis and other glyphs from the SMP). The bookmarks import file comes with a sample of these.

3. Unicode Text Replacement
  A collection of bookmarklets to replace standard Latin (or in some cases Greek) characters with formatted of pseudofont variants.

  3.1 Standard Character replacements
    Change text into Sᴍᴀʟʟ Cᴀᴩs, ˢᵘᵖᵉʳˢᶜʳⁱᵖᵗ, Ⓒⓘⓡⓒⓛⓔⓓ, ⒫⒜⒭⒠⒩⒯⒣⒠⒮⒤⒮⒠⒟ or Ｆｕｌｌｗｉｔｈ variants.

  3.2 Math Pseudofont Substitutions
    Change text into various Math pseudofont styles from the SMP. E.g. 𝖲𝖺𝗇𝗌, 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓,  𝙼𝚘𝚗𝚘𝚜𝚙𝚊𝚌𝚎, 𝔻𝕠𝕦𝕓𝕝𝕖-𝕊𝕥𝕣𝕦𝕔𝕜, 𝒞𝒶𝓁𝒾ℊ𝓇𝒶𝓅𝒽𝓎 or 𝔉𝔯𝔞𝔨𝔱𝔲𝔯.
  These characters may not display correctly on all devices. Please use with care!
  
The easiest way to get started is to download the sample bookmarks file, which you can import into your browser’s bookmarks (best move the folder "Bookmarklets" into your bookmarks toolbar for quick access.
